My career has changed much in the last several years. I no longer code in JavaScript building frontends or backends. I don’t even write any golang much. There is barely any time to program in these days of my infrastructure enginerring career.</p>\n<p>Mostly, <code class=\"language-text\">terraform</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">HCL</code> consume me, and so does other aspects of infrastructure engineering. I work in a small but talented team for a cloud footprint optimization shop. Check us out when you get a chance at <a href=\"https://stormforge.io\">stormforge.io</a>.</p>\n<p>Other technologies I work with on a day-to-day basis are <code class=\"language-text\">kubectl</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">kustomize</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">argo-cd</code> and a whole host of other monitoring tools that are there to make our lives easier in the operations world. Here, I plan on dropping in from time to time, and share my learnings.</p>\n<p>Best.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings","date":"September 13, 2021","description":"I am reigniting my tech blog after a long hiatus from any kind of technical writing."}},"previous":null,"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"7546143e-65e3-5520-a228-3d63a265e334","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":null}},
