Hi all,

It's been a while since I jot down any tech ideas outside of work. My career has changed much in the last several years. I no longer code in JavaScript building frontends or backends. I don't even write any golang much. There is barely any time to program in these days of my infrastructure enginerring career.

Mostly, `terraform` and `HCL` consume me, and so does other aspects of infrastructure engineering. I work in a small but talented team for a cloud footprint optimization shop. Check us out when you get a chance at [stormforge.io](https://stormforge.io).

Other technologies I work with on a day-to-day basis are `kubectl`, `kustomize`, `argo-cd` and a whole host of other monitoring tools that are there to make our lives easier in the operations world. Here, I plan on dropping in from time to time, and share my learnings.

Best.
